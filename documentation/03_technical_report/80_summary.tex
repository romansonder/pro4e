\subsection*{Main idea and facts}

The following summary gives the reader an overview about the EIT Project 4 FS18 called Dojo - The networked art museum. The goal of this project is to develop the electronics for an intelligent museums guide. Summarising, the main idea of the project is to make an audio guide with a bone conductor.

\subsection*{Background}

The project is based on a bachelor thesis of a graduate of University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland HGK in Basel. The graduate, which is the client of this project, has developed the idea of an intelligent museums guide and also created the design. The part of this project is to develop the electronic, which fulfils the clients requirements.

\subsection*{Alternative}

As desired by the client, the audio transmission works with a bone conductor. One alternative would be the use of ordinary headphones, but would be less hygienic than the solution with the bone conductor. Therefore, all the focus was spent on this bone conductor transmission.

\subsection*{Conclusions}

Since the design of the museum guide was already set by the client, we had to choose a small $AAA$ accumulator to supply the electronics. This decision ends up in a short running time, which is limited to the minimum of estimated visitor time, but depends on the users behaviour.

Further, the number of files that can be stored on the museums guide is limited to a small amount as the devices only supports small SD-Cards.

\subsection*{Recommendations}

All the needed hardware and software were developed and tested in this project, but not yet tested in a big environment. To bring it to the market, another project should be launched to test and verify the museums guide in a real environment to get an insight, how it acts and whether it could replace the ordinary headphone solutions or not.

\subsection*{Key financial numbers}

The final version of prototype costs 135.- and comes with all needed electronic and software to configure the museums guide. We estimated that the price of production would be about 55.- per unit, depending on the ordered amount.

Since the Dojo comes with all needed software to configure the museums guide, there will be no maintenance costs except of the electricity costs for loading the accumulators.
